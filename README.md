# What Crypto Noobs is About

Here at Cypto Noobs our objective is to give anyone the ability to get their hands dirty in the space of crypto.  By giving the user basic information to go off, the easy understandablity of this site allows the user to feel less overwhelemed when jumping into a world with hundreds of thousands of projects.  This website is aimed to be for begginers who are curious and want to get started in the crypto space without having to dive through the countless scam articles, their friends telling them to invest in a new dog coin, and getting tagged endlessly on twitter about this new and upcoming NFT project that says they are the next thing that is "going to the moon".  

# Basic is Better

This is a motto we strive off of when this site was created.  With a easy to navigate navbar at the top and distinct uses for each page the user is able to recieve direct and strong information along with simple forms to log the info they find important about their projects all while allowing them to keep a wishlist of coins they are interested in or own.

## The Home page

A home page is what grabs the users attention and tells them everything they need to know about what they will be getting themselves into when they explore the rest of the page.  With a welcomeing title and a list of what users can expect upon entering the site, the home page is a very welcoming place to land on.

## The Wishlist

This page is designed to allow our users to fill out a form using our controlled form format to create a list of coins they are interested or have even purchased.  This was created to allow simple orginization in a world with many many products.  The two most important pieces of information when it comes to a project is a name and a discription of why this product will succeed.  We allowed the user to write their own description in their own words because in the world of the metaverse contains an obscene amount of meta-language.  The description box allows the user to write about the project in their own words so they can refer back to it later and be able to understand why they picked this project.  With the delete button available if a user wants to edit this list the option is always available to delete the project with the click of a button.

## Price Display

Price display page is our favorite part of this page.  With the help of CoinGeckos API we are able to clearly display 100 of the top projects in the crypto space right now inclduing the name, live prive, and a symbol of the coin so users are able to get a great first mark about the project.  The decision to leave the discription out of the display of coins was a tough but user friendly decision.  We wanted to give the user a just enough info about a project to get their intrests sparked.  Whether its the interesting name, cool picture, or a low price point, we want the user to take the info from that page and go out to do their own already slimmed down research and once they have an idea about the coin, go back to our wishlist page, add it to their list and write what they think of the coin and how it works in their own words.
